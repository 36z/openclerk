<title>Your Failing {$exchange} {$label} has been Re-enabled</title>
<p><b>Hello {$name},</b></p>

<p>
  <a href="{$url}">One of your {$exchange} {$labels}</a> ({$title}) configured in {$site_name},
  that had been disabled temporarily due to repeated failures, has been automatically re-enabled.
</p>

<p>
  This may be because {$site_name} has updated how it queries {$exchange} {$labels}, or {$exchange} is no longer down.
</p>

<p>
  You can remove or disable this {$label} by visiting <a href="{$url}">your {$site_name} accounts wizard</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for using {$site_name}!
</p>
