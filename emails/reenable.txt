Your Failing {$exchange} {$label} has been Re-enabled
Hello {$name},

One of your {$exchange} {$labels} ({$title}) configured in {$site_name}, that had been disabled temporarily due to repeated failures, has been automatically re-enabled.

This may be because {$site_name} has updated how it queries {$exchange} {$labels}, or {$exchange} is no longer down.

You can remove or disable this {$label} by visiting your {$site_name} accounts wizard:

Thanks for using {$site_name}!

{$site_url}
